      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Lakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine. We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to DVDs and popcorn for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
